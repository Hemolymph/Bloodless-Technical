**Q: I have Blue Pawn in play, and summon Blood Druid naming Blue Kingdom as its kin. Does blue pawn trigger?**

**A:** It does not. BD does not gain Blue Kingdom kin, it simply stores it as part of the effect. In fact, even if BD said "this card's kin becomes the named kin" it would still not trigger BP, because it was played before it had the kin.

**Q: In the following opponent board state, I play Rage of the Lurker. What happens?**

| 1     | 2            | 3     | 4     |
| ----- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |
| Flask | THEIR_VESSEL | Flask | Flask |
| | | | 

Only the first Flask enters the discard pile. The other two die after THEIR_VESSEL's effect terminates.

**Q: In the previous board state, what if I'm executing it during my opponent's turn**

| 1     | 2            | 3     | 4     |
| ----- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |
| Flask | THEIR_VESSEL | Flask | Flask |
| | | | 

Only the rightmost two flasks enter the discard pile, as they are leftmost from the active player's perspective.

**Q: In the following board state, I begin the attack phase. My opponent has Revitalificate in hand. Can they use it to buff their Mosquito and thus prevent its death?**

| 1     | 2            | 3     | 4     |
| ----- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |
| Veteran Commander | Mosquito |  |  |
| Mosquito | Spider | Empty | Empty | 

Yes.

**Q: In the following board state, my opponent has Dog Treats in hand. Can they summon a creature to make the Dog move and prevent it from being attacked.**

| 1     | 2            | 3     | 4     |
| ----- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |
| | Veteran Commander |  |  |
| | Mosquito| Dog | Empty | 

I am undecided on the behavior I want on this. The current behavior is: Yes, because attacks are tied to spaces and not creatures.

**Q: In the same vein as the previous question, can I use a similar technique to move the dog to a new space and let it attack twice?**

Same as the previous question.

**Q: The board is full of 8 veteran commanders. I play Rage of the Lurker. What order to the triggers resolve in?**

Active player first, opposing player second. Left to right.

**Q: Both players have Veteran Commander. I play Rage of the Lurker. My opponent executes Red Queen, ending my turn. Does my VetCom survive? If not, do I get to execute a command due to its trigger? If so, which turn is it executed on?**

Your Veteran Commander survives, as all attacks are canceled due to the turn having ended.

Red Queen ends your opponent's turn. It becomes your turn again.

**Q: Can I play THEIR_WATCHER with X=0 to gain 1 blood**
The answer is no.

The question is why not. The status quo (due to precedent) is that it gets played and sacrificed immediately.

I have been considering that playing a zero-health creature is just a thing that cannot be done.
