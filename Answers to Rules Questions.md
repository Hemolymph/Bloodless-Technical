**Q: I have Blue Pawn in play, and summon Blood Druid naming Blue Kingdom as its kin. Does blue pawn trigger?**

**A:** It does not. BD does not gain Blue Kingdom kin, it simply stores it as part of the effect. In fact, even if BD said "this card's kin becomes the named kin" it would still not trigger BP, because it was played before it had the kin.
